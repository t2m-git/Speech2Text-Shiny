So my ideal Valentine's Day Of course my missus has to be there, my goal. Hopefully the arsenal verse many other games on as well. I will be sitting there by the couch, I'll probably have a six pack of Heidi couldn't she couldn't have her wine. I probably have cooked lunch, because I know she would not want to watch the football so I'd had to cook lunch as a compromise. And yeah, hopefully all snow winds come on your guns.
