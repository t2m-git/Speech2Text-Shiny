So the last Valentine's Day, I took my girlfriend to Paris and we went to Disneyland. And the most romantic thing that I did was I made dinner reservations at this restaurant that was like a at the top floor and it has a view of the Eiffel Tower at night, and I just told her how much she means to me when because I don't know if you guys know this but on every hour of the Eiffel Tower sparkles. So, timely, or in its sparkle and an email, and have a nice.
