Okay, so I can tell you before so during like my Yeah, hold on, let me start this one more time, um, the thing what I've done is I've done a quiz before with that lady that lasted for two weeks prior to the Valentine's Day, and she had to come up with the answer through each day but still couldn't, you know, kind of complete in total until the 14th of February, so it started on the first, and I dragged down all the way to the 14th totally mad. That's why I said, I'm not gonna like this anymore. And the case was you couldn't finish the quiz like the last question. So it was a good idea but, yeah.
