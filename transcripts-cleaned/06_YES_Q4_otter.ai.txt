I don't know if it's appropriate to say on live television. Um, I think someone who comes up with another idea except the flowers and chocolate is really good though. But, I mean, guys are supposed to like, you know, bring flowers and chocolate. I don't believe in that I think like we can also do other stuff but then again, you got to find the right and presence so out of the box is probably in my personal opinion better than flowers and chocolate.
