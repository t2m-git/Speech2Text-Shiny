I would say in terms of like a song or poetry or something, because this is something personal and you can send through your lover. During the day, which I think is pretty cool. So if you play an instrument for instance, and record a song and send that one. That is a good idea for Valentine's Day this year. Yeah, I would say, I can see myself using a digital method. However, I think everything that's more personal, is better.
